Isolating plant leaves from images is a critical task in computer vision, particularly in applications like plant health monitoring, agricultural analysis, and automated crop management. However, the appearance of leaves can vary significantly under different lighting conditions, such as sunlight, shade, or artificial light. These variations affect the color properties of the leaves, making it challenging to develop robust algorithms for consistent detection.  

The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space provides a powerful tool for handling these variations, as it separates color information (Hue) from brightness (Value). By carefully testing and fine-tuning HSV thresholds under various lighting conditions, we can enhance the reliability of leaf isolation, enabling accurate segmentation and analysis across diverse environments. This process is essential for developing adaptable and scalable solutions in agricultural technology and environmental monitoring.
